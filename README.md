# university_3nd_year
This repository contains some of my work during my third year at FER, Zagreb. Subdirectories are arranged by faculty courses. I only included some of my work, which I thought significantly benefited me as I'm working towards becoming a CS engineer. Everything provided in this repository is a part of either an exercise, homework or project that was organized as a faculty course by FER.

More examples will be added when the semester ends.
