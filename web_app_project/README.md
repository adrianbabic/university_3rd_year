# web_app_project
This web application was part of a group project where our task was to create a functional web app for arranging a private lesson between a student and teacher. For the frontend, we used React.js, and for the backend, we used Spring Boot. Main features of our app include registration/login functionality, as well as storing, updating and deleting data in the database. My work reflects on the calendar component of the application (both backend and frontend). Bear in mind that for most of us, this was the first time working with the mentioned technologies.
